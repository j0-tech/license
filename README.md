# The j0 tech license
We (j0 tech) license our open-source code under the terms of this license. We don't like legalese,
so this license is written with informal language.

Under this license, we allow you to use, modify, etc. our code to your heart's content - with a few caveats, however.
Here's what you _**can't**_ do:

  *  **Monetize our code without modifying it first.** In other words, you can't sell our code as-is, without making modifications
     of your own. Our definition of "modification" is very lenient, however. Here's a few examples of what we consider "modified":
     * Adding your own extensions
     * Optimizations, improvements, and the like
     * Porting to other platforms or languages
     * Restructuring of the internals of the software
     If you would like clarification on a case-by-case basis, please contact us.
  *  **Claim that our code was written by you.** Unless you actually work for us and you *did* write it. In that case, by all means,
     go ahead and say you wrote it.
  *  **Use our code in a monetized product without attribution.** If you use our code in a product that is monetized, we ask that you
     give us credit for our code in your product.

For the most part, anything else is fair game.
